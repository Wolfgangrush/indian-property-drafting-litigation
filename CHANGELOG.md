## [0.2.3-alpha] — 2026-05-25

### Explicit per-agent invocation of `pair_md_to_docx.sh`

v0.2.2 documented the output-pairing rule in `_drafting_common/SKILL.md` and relied on every agent picking up the rule by reference. v0.2.3 makes the invocation EXPLICIT in each agent's prompt — Reader, Format, Drafter, Verifier, Refiner, Overseer — so the pairing happens deterministically rather than depending on inherited-rule compliance.

### Changed

- **Reader prompt** — after writing `case-facts.md`, explicit `pair_md_to_docx.sh case-facts.md` invocation appended.
- **Format prompt** — after writing `format-shell.md`, explicit invocation appended.
- **Drafter prompt** — explicit invocation appended (Drafter already had a pandoc command from v0.2.1; the helper invocation is now also documented as the canonical path).
- **Verifier prompt** — after writing `verification-report.md`, explicit invocation appended.
- **Refiner prompt** — after writing `draft-v2.md`, explicit invocation appended.
- **Overseer prompt** — after writing `opposing-notes.md` and `final-draft.md`, two explicit invocations appended.

### Why the change

User feedback 2026-05-25: relying on each agent to inherit the rule from `_drafting_common` is not robust enough. The Drafter has the pandoc command spelled out and it works; the other 5 agents had only the inherited rule. Explicit per-agent invocation makes the pairing deterministic. Once every agent reliably outputs both `.md` and `.docx`, a pipeline run on any forum becomes itself a calibration probe — the advocate visually inspects the rendered `.docx` from each stage and identifies any per-forum formatting gaps, without needing 14 separate gold-standard pleadings upfront.

## [0.2.2-alpha] — 2026-05-24

### Transactional-instrument reference.docx + output-pairing discipline

This plugin produces transactional instruments (contracts / conveyancing deeds), not pleadings. The v0.2.1 reference.docx wrongly applied the Bombay HC Nagpur pleading style (TNR 14pt 1.5 spacing, spaced + UNDERLINED bold-centered section headers, "MOST RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH:" anchor) — wholly inappropriate for commercial documents. v0.2.2 ships a correctly-calibrated transactional reference.docx.

### Added

- **Transactional `reference.docx`** at `skills/<base>/reference.docx` — TNR 12pt body, single line spacing, 2.5cm margins all around, Heading 1 bold centered (NOT underlined) for document title, Heading 2 bold left for section titles (e.g., "1. DEFINITIONS"), Heading 3 bold italic left for sub-sections, Heading 4 italic left for sub-sub-sections. No spaced section headers. No underlining of headings. Page numbers bottom-center.
- **`build_reference_docx.py`** (transactional variant) — reproducible build script for the transactional reference.docx.
- **`pair_md_to_docx.sh`** — helper script that every agent calls after writing a `.md` output. Pairs every Markdown artifact with a `.docx` using the shipped reference.docx + the post-pandoc table-width fix.
- **OUTPUT-PAIRING DISCIPLINE** section in `_drafting_common/SKILL.md` documenting the per-agent output-pairing map and the helper-script usage.

### Changed

- **reference.docx style** for transactional instruments is now correctly differentiated from pleading style. Pleading-style v0.2.1 reference.docx is REMOVED from this plugin and replaced with the transactional variant.
- **Pipeline output convention** — every agent's `.md` output is now paired with a `.docx`. Advocates do not natively read Markdown; every artifact is opened in Word.

### Migration

Any existing case folders that produced output under v0.2.1 should re-run the Drafter to produce the corrected `.docx` files in the transactional style. The `.md` source files remain unchanged.

## [0.2.1-alpha] — 2026-05-24

### Filing-grade render-defect repair + pipeline-optionality

The v0.1.0 render path produced filing-grade Markdown but the pandoc → `.docx` conversion failed Bombay HC / equivalent Registry expectations on multiple counts (title not bold, section headers left-aligned, Index table column-headers wrapping vertically, party block leaking onto cover pages, ~6,200-word bloat). This release repairs the render path, calibrated against an actual filed Bombay HC Nagpur Second Appeal pleading the author supplied as the filing-grade reference. Inherits the v0.2.1 fixes from `indian-hc-drafting-litigation`.

### Added

- **Pre-customised `reference.docx`** in the plugin's base-skill folder with locked Word styles (TNR 14pt body, 1.5 line spacing, 4cm left / 2.5cm right-top-bottom margins, Heading 1 bold centered, Heading 2 bold + UNDERLINED + centered + letter-spacing for the spaced `F A C T S` effect, Heading 3 bold + UNDERLINED + centered for unspaced section headers, Heading 4 bold + UNDERLINED + left for `MOST RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH:` style anchors, fixed table layout).
- **`build_reference_docx.py`** — reproducible python-docx build script for the shipped reference.docx.
- **`fix_docx_tables.py`** — post-pandoc Python script that forces column widths on every table (5-col 8/8/60/14/10; 4-col 10/10/65/15; 3-col 10/75/15; 2-col 18/82). Locks first-row bold + centered + vertically-centered cells. Drafter runs this as the final post-pandoc step.
- **MARKDOWN HEADING DISCIPLINE** in the Drafter prompt + base SKILL.md (Heading 1 / Heading 2 / Heading 3 / Heading 4 mapping for court header / spaced section headers / unspaced section headers / left-anchored headings).
- **VERBOSITY DISCIPLINE** with per-case-type word-count targets and hard ceilings.
- **PIPELINE-OPTIONALITY** — Verifier / Refiner / Overseer now OPTIONAL QC layers. Default exit point is after Stage 3 (Drafter).
- **COVER-PAGE DISCIPLINE** — INDEX / SYNOPSIS / LIST OF ANNEXURES each begin on `\newpage` with short cause-title only.
- **Bold-number paragraph convention** — Facts and Grounds paragraphs use `**1.** **2.** **3.**`.
- **Inline-bold highlighting convention** for property descriptors / annexure markers / key terms within Facts narrative.

### Changed

- **Drafter pandoc command** is now TWO steps (pandoc → .docx, then `fix_docx_tables.py`). Step 2 is non-negotiable; skipping it reproduces the v0.2.0 stacking-column defect.

### Cost / token-budget note

Running the full 6-agent pipeline burns approximately 600K tokens per draft, which can exhaust an advocate's Claude session limit. v0.2.1 makes Stages 4–6 OPTIONAL so a baseline Reader → Format → Drafter run (~280K tokens) is sufficient for routine pleadings. The optional QC stages remain available for high-stakes matters.

### Notes on this release

This is a **v0.1.0-alpha scaffold release**. The structural skeletons, agent pipeline, base skills, and 10 case-type skill frames are in place. Deep per-skill encoding (full clause libraries for each instrument type, State-specific stamp-duty calculations integrated with current Ready Reckoner values, deeper personal-law overlays for Muslim / Christian / Parsi succession matters, integration with State-specific land-records and mutation portals, and bench-specific Practice Directions for the Sub-Registrar circles in major cities) will land in v0.1.0 and onward.
